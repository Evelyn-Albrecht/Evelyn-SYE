In this document, I am going to attempt converting the camera trap data detection to a usable matrix for occupancy modeling

clear environment and open relevant packages

```{r}
rm(list=ls())
library(tidyverse)
library("here")
```

read in the data

```{r}
cams <- read.csv(here("Data","new-data","Pre_2020_cam_data.csv"))
```

lets take a glimpse at the data

```{r}
glimpse(cams)
```

Change the species (choice) to a factor variable. then look to see how many unique species there are

```{r}
cams$choice <- as.factor(cams$choice)
unique(cams$choice)
```

yay! there are both fishers and porcupines present. now lets get onto organizing the data.

I will be taking a lot of information
