## Calculating pi*r*-squared

Say you have a column, called radius

```{r}
radius <- c(3.25, 0.98, 5.23)
```

Those represent the radius (or as in your data, distance from center of homerange to edge)

To calculate area, need a = pi \* r-squared

do the math

```{r}
area <- (radius*radius)*pi
area

```
